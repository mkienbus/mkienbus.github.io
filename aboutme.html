                    I am new to software engineering, as I graduated from a full stack web development course through Flatiron School in April. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.
                <br>
                    I am looking for full time work as a junior web developer or apprenticeship at this time, and I am open to in person, flex, or remote work.
                <br>
                    I received my Bachelor's degree from Colorado State University in Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice in 2014, and I am currently a Correctional Officer with the Colorado Department of Corrections. 
                <br>
                    Previously, I was a Sergeant in a mountain infantry unit in the Colorado Army National Guard, and a government military contractor with domestic and overseas experience.
