                <p>
                        <span id = "tab"></span>I was a Sergeant in a mountain infantry unit in the Colorado Army National Guard, and a government military contractor with domestic and overseas experience.
                    <br>
                        <span id = "tab"></span>I received my Bachelor's degree from Colorado State University in Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice in 2014, and I am currently a Correctional Officer with the Colorado Department of Corrections.
                    <br>
                        <span id = "tab"></span>After a decade in the military and law enforcement, I am looking to change careers into the  web development community in order to support my family in a dynamic and challenging field which I thoroughly enjoy.
                    <br>
                        <span id = "tab"></span>I graduated from a full stack web development course through Flatiron School in April. I studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sinatra, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.
                    <br>
                        <span id = "tab"></span>Most importantly, I learned how to think like a programmer. Now I know I can learn any language as needed, as well as solve problems as they arise.
                    <br>
                        <span id = "tab"></span>I am looking for full time work as a web developer or an apprenticeship at this time, and I am open to in person, flex, or remote work.
